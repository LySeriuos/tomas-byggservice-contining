Design

The main idea was to create a stylish website with easy readable fonts and colours. The main fonts are ["Exo"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo?query=Exo) and "Exo"["Open Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans). As a back up font going to be "Sans Serif". Colours was chosed to get fit in all pages and the main colour was brown as a main Hero image in the Home page.

Visualization

The selected images are realtive to the company specialization and gives one more information of what services has company.
All images has alternative text to describe the images if something happens with the network.

* For the best user expierence smaller screen has toggler icon as collapsible sidebar menu to get full expierennce of the webpage.
* Home and About Us pages has Call to action buttons and redirects user to cotact page to fill up the form.

Home Page
The Home Page has two columns and smaller screens has one column. 
* Hero image used as the full width background image and it covers entire webpage on all devices to make a strong first impression. 
* Middle container divided by two columns on Desktop Home page, taking 50% each column. On a smaller screens left column is taking the top position and the right column goes under it to have best clarity. Left column has information about possible projects and the right column has company motto.


About Us page

The About Us page is a little bit different from Home Page but it is still two collumns wide on Desktop and one column on the smaller screens.
* Hero image occupying 50% of the page on the right side. When resolution became smaller and responsive design turn on, Hero image take "under" position and filling full width of the screen.
* Middle container on the left side shows company's history and it takes another half of the page. On smaller screens text is talking top position.

Gallery page

* Hero image is used like in the Home page, to make a nice full size background of the webpage on all screen sizes.
* Middle conaitner or main area of the page is build as a gallery to make best possible presentation of company's projects and divided in three columns. Modal image gallery is leting me to show best quality images. On the tablet screens gallery changes to 2 columns and on the mobile phone screen sizes it changes to one column. It is importatnt same size of the picture on all screen to be viewable.

Conatact Page

* Hero image is used like in the Home page, to make a nice full size background of the webpage on all screen sizes.
* Middle container is divided to two columns on the desktop. On the left collumn has the form to be filled up. The form is simple, but makes easy to request information from the building company. The right side column has all the contact details. Smaller resolutions makes this page only one column. The form takes top position and the contact details is under it.
